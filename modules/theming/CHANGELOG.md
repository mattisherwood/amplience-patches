# Theming Changelog

## 2026-04-27 (extension v2.2.4)

### Fixed

- Prevented the temporary `login-prompt` route from creating a stored hub theme.

### Added

- Added dots to the Hub-switcher menu, each showing its own saved theme colour.
- (Extracted the hub-switcher row colour logic into a dedicated theming script to keep the main theming runtime simpler.)

## 2026-04-24 (extension v2.2.3)

### Added

- Per-hub theme storage keyed by hub name, including `label`, `color`, and `isDark` values for each hub.
- Automatic creation of a default theme entry when visiting a hub that does not already have one.
- Friendly hub label detection from the DC hub selector, cached alongside each hub theme.
- Multi-row theme controls in popup and options with one row per hub and a remove button.

### Changed

- The theming runtime now applies theme values based on the current URL hub and reapplies on in-app URL changes.
- Theming controls moved from single global values to per-hub controls in both popup and options.

### Fixed

- Correct theme context is now maintained when switching between hubs in the same browser session.

### Notes

- Legacy single-theme keys (`themingColor`, `themingDark`) are no longer used.

## 2026-04-22 (extension v2.2.1)

### Fixed

- Styles applied across further pages: editing pages, scheduling etc.

### Changed

- Updated default colour to match existing default
- Cleaning up of colour variables
